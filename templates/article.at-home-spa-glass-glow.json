Oil cleansers are known for their ability to remove makeup and impurities while maintaining the skin's natural oils. This method ensures a thorough clean and can contribute to a clearer complexion.Some people find that incorporating oil cleansing into their routine helps achieve a healthy, radiant glow.</p><p><strong>Use a Gentle Cleanser : </strong>After cleansing makeup or sunscreen with Oil cleanser, choose gentle low PH level, soothing cleanser that does not strip the skin of its natural oils, leading to dryness and dullness. Our Lotus Leaf Cleanser helps purify and cleanse pollutants with low PH6 Level, as maintaining the moisture of the skin.  </p><p><strong>Deeply Moisturizing Toner : </strong>Look for toners that are specifically formulated with hydrating ingredients, such as hyaluronic acid, glycerin, or ceramides. Also soothing and repairing ingredients such as : Lotus Leaf and Calming natural ingredients help to attract and retain moisture, giving your skin a plump and dewy appearance. </p><p><strong>Double Layering Toner : </strong>Consider a Korean toner layering technique that involves applying multiple layers of a hydrating toner.
