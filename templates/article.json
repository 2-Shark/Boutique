Yoo<\/em><\/p><p>At the age of 27, my skin and career were facing the hardest and most challenging times of my life. Due to heavy workloads at the advertising agency, hormonal changes, eating habits, and a lack of exercise and stress management, my skin had to endure severe dehydration and acne. I still remember how hard I tried to cure my acne and scars through countless methods, including dermatology, clinical laser treatments, and home care. My skin was diagnosed as dry, sensitive, acne-prone, with pigmentation issues and uneven skin tone. My skin's age was assessed as 32 at the age of 27. I discovered that various skin concerns, including dehydration occurring in one's 20s, can contribute to certain skin issues that might make your skin appear older or show signs of premature aging if not properly managed. I needed safe, trustworthy anti-aging skincare products suitable for sensitive skin. Moreover, my physical and mental health needed to be treated in a healthier way. Starting with proper skincare knowledge and ingredients, adopting wellness habits, exercising regularly, and improving my natural and organic eating habits helped me overcome my challenges. I found the proper way to care for my skin through a foundational understanding of the power of natural ingredients and skincare know-how.<\/p><p><br\/>Thesedays, the combination of increased life expectancy and accelerated aging has become a prominent issue, largely due to modern lifestyles, hectic daily routines, dietary choices, exposure to UV light, stress, and environmental factors.
